# Resource files for WinCompose

Upgrading [Sam Hocevar's WinCompose](http://wincompose.info/) [`samhocevar/wincompose`](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose) routinely overwrites my resource files, where I have a bunch of custom key combinations installed.

So, after compare against a manually archived version of my files a few upgrades ago, I figured I should just create a repo so I can get a changelog as well as easy diffing.
